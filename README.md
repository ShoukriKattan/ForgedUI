# ForgedUI
ForgedUI is a drag and drop UI editor built for Titanium (Appcelerator)
There are multiple projects that are related to ForgedUI 

1- The ForgedUI Drag and Drop editor built on top of Eclipse GEF.  The editor itself as a product was made available for users and was paid. 

2- ForgedUI project (This project) is a grails application that is a backend that is used to register users to allow them to use the Eclipse plugin. 
Users had to register with Appcelerator marketplace (AppDirect) to use our product. 

This project implements OpenID to perform single sign on with the Marketplace. 
OAUTH and Integration with AppDirect APIs.
Licensing Service to determine whether a user is allowed to use the ForgedUI plugin and has licensed it. 

Apologies that project lacks documentation but feel free to ask questions and I can try to answer and document.
